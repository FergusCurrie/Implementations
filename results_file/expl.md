Only run has failedi in bagging so far. 

Can go through 'e' files looking for errors. 


4082125 = bagboost = GP/BagGP/NicheGP/CCGP run across all datasets. (with appropriate gp predict functions)

4082851 = FastGP multiclass , some terminated so needs to be rerun


4082885 = MOGP run, final method failed (PFMOGP). Needs a partial re run.
